Malaysia lies in the tropics and is blessed with plenty of rain and sunshine. Many types of trees and plants grow here. Among them are those that bear delicious fruits.
The "King of Fruits" is without doubt the durian. It is an oval-shaped fruit about the size of a rugby ball. Its skin is green or yellow and covered with many sharp thorns. Inside, however, the yellow flesh is soft and sweet. Its smell is very strong. The locals love the durian, but foreigners find the smell hard to bear.

The durian is a seasonal fruit. It normally is in season twice a year. So are other fruits like the mangosteen, langsat, duku, rambutan and mango. We consume these fruits in great quantities.

Other fruits like the papaya, pineapple, banana and star fruit are not seasonal. They are obtainable at all times. Again we consume these fruits in large quantities. In a hot country like Malaysia, fruits provide us with much needed water and other nutrients that are vital for health. Often the fruit-stalls are crowded with people waiting to buy a slice of papaya, pineapple or watermelon to quench their thirst.

We are lucky to have such a huge variety of fruits. In addition to that we get imported fruits like apples and grapes, but they are usually more expensive. So we spend our money mainly on local fruits. I would say that it is money well-spent.
