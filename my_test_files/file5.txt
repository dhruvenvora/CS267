Birdman Records is an independent record label based in South San Francisco, founded by former Warner Bros. Records A&R vice-president David Katznelson.
Birdman Records is the flagship label of the Birdman Recording Group, which includes other labels such as Sepia Tone Records, Tornado Records and Tariff Records. The label was founded in 2000, following the departure of David Katznelson from Warner Bros. Records.[1]

In addition to its focus on particular artists, the label produced More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album, a 1999 tribute album to the late Skip Spence, featuring contributions from Robert Plant, Beck and Tom Waits, among others, with the objective at the time of funding Spence's medical care. Spence died shortly before the release of the record, but is reported to have heard some or all of it prior to his death.[2] Katznelson was the executive producer of the album.
