Teluk Kemang is about 12 kilometres from Port Dickson town in Negeri Sembilan. It is a popular beach where many people go to and relax on.
It was on one of the days of the Chinese New Year holidays that we had a picnic at Teluk Kemang. I went there with my uncle and his family. There were five of us, my uncle, his wife, their two young children and me. My uncle drove us there in his car.

We arrived there at about ten in the morning. The beach was already crowded with other holiday-makers. Anyhow we managed to get a place in the shade of a large tree and we put our things there. My aunt laid out a mat for us to sit on.

In double-quick time we were enjoying ourselves in the sea, except my aunt. She just sat on the mat watching us.

The water was cool and refreshing and I loved splashing it on my cousins. However the hot sun above can be quite uncomfortable. So after about an hour or so, my uncle told us to sit in the shade for a while. The sun was getting increasingly hot. So we reluctantly came out of the sea.

In the shade of some trees we built some sandcastles.

Time passed so quickly. Soon we heard my aunt calling us to have lunch. We ran to her and helped ourselves to the delicious curry she had brought. Then we had several glasses of ice-cold drink from the Thermos flask.

After lunch we played a while more in the sea. The sun was just too hot. So we walked over to one of the hotels nearby and washed ourselves with clean freshwater.

When we returned, my aunt had already packed everything in the car. So all of us got into the car and my uncle drove us back home to Seremban.
