The road in front of my school is a narrow one. It is also very busy. Every afternoon when school is dismissed the road becomes almost impassable as children, bicycles, cars and buses jostle and struggle to use it. Sometimes a policeman is there to help things out, but generally chaos reigns and we have to be careful not to get involved in an accident.
A few accidents had already occurred. I was a witness to one.

If happened just after school. As usual the road was an utter mad house. Children were running across the road to get to their cars and buses. Cars and buses honked angrily at them.

Just then I saw a young boy make a dash across the road. There was a loud blare of horn, a squeal of brakes and I saw a car knock into the boy. He fell as though his feet were swept from under him.

Fortunately the car was not moving very fast and the driver managed to stop the car before a wheel could run over the fallen boy.

All traffic stopped. I ran over to the boy and saw blood on the road. He was bleeding from a cut on his head. A man came and examined the boy. Then he lifted the boy and carried him to a car. They sped off, presumably to the hospital.

Many people surrounded the driver who looked dazed and bewildered. A policeman came to calm things down.

As there was nothing I could do, I turned and walked down the road carefully. It was terrible to witness an accident. I certainly would not like to be involved in one.
There is one more character who is my favorite. He is Yogi Bear. My favourite time of the day is between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.
