My favorite cartoon character is Dishonest John, or DJ, for short. Dressed in black and uttering his famous "Nyak, ah, ah" laugh he makes life difficult for all those around him. However, as always, he will be outwitted and all his devious plans will fail. So every week I watch him go about his antics only to lose in the end. He is such a character that many of my friends have even adopted his laugh.
Another favorite character of mine is Big Baby Huey in the show "Casper The Friendly Ghost". Huey is such a overgrown lumbering but innocent baby duck who goes around happily defeating the bad guys without really trying to. He is quite a sight to watch as he sucks on his milk bottle and then knocks the lights out of the sly fox who tries to take advantage of him. It is bad luck for anyone with bad intention, for soon Huey will show him that it does not pay to do bad things.

There is one more character who is my favorite. He is Yogi Bear who lives in Jellystone National Park. This lovable rascal and his little buddy Boo Boo Bear always seem to be getting into trouble with the park ranger. Yogi's favorite pastime is pinching food from the park's visitors. The ranger's unending task is to stop Yogi from doing it.

All in all, cartoon characters are great fun. They show us what people can get up to. I am sure all of us who watch these shows are entertained by them.
